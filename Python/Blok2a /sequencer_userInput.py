"""
An example project in which a rhythmical sequence (one measure, 1 sample) is played.
  - Sixteenth note is the smallest used note duration.
  - One meassure, time signature: 3 / 4

Instead of using steps to iterate through a sequence, we are checking the time.
We will trigger events based on a timestamp.

------ HANDS-ON TIPS ------
- Run the code, read the code and answer the following question:
  - This script transforms a list of 'sixteenth notes timestamps' into a list of
    regular timestamps.
    In the playback loop, the time difference (currentTime minus startTime)
    is compared to the upcomming timestamp.
    Why is this a more accurate method then the methods used in the examples
    "04_randomNoteDuration.py" and "05_oneSampleSequenceSteps.py"?
    Notate your answer below this line (Dutch is allowed)!
    Omdat dat je een discrete tijdfactor geeft die ritmisch onderverdeeld is in
    tijdseenheden.
- Alter the code:
  Currently one sample is played. Add another sample to the script.
  When a sample needs to be played, choose one of the two samples
  randomly.
  (See the hint about the random package in script "02_timedPlayback".)

- Alter the code:
  Currently the sequence is only played once.
  Alter the code to play it multiple times.
  hint: The timestamps list is emptied using the pop() function.
  (multiple possible solutions)
