"""
An example project in which three wav files are played after eachother with a
minor break in between.

------ HANDS-ON TIPS ------
- Alter the code:
  Write a function that plays the samples a given number of times.
  Use this function.

- Alter the code:
  Change the time in between samples into a random value.
  E.g. wait 0.25, 0.5, or 1 second.
  hint:  there is a standard random package available with a random function
         https://docs.python.org/2/library/random.html
         A standard package does not need to be installed with pip, but it does
         need to be imported.

# play samples, wait 1 second in between
for sample in samples:
  # display the sample object
  print(sample)
  # play sample
  sample.play()
  # wait 1 second
