"""
An example project in which three wav files are played after eachother.

------ HANDS-ON TIPS ------
- Answer the following question before running the code:
  Do you expect to hear the samples played simultaniously or after eachother?
  Why?

- Alter the code:
  Play the sounds simultaniously.

- Alter the code:
  Ask the user to choice which one of the three samples should be played and
  only play the chosen sample.
